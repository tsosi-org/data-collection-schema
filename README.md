# Schema used by TSOSI to collect data

TSOSI is a recent data platform launched in June 2025; see [tsosi.org](https://tsosi.org). It promotes transparency regarding financial support made for open science infrastructure. It's a tool for research institutions and infrastructures to implement open data related to financial support. At launch, the data source consists solely of infrastructure, and we are working on designing a process that will also allow institutions to provide data. See: 

- [Data schema for infrastructure](#data-schema-for-infrastructure)

- [Data schema for institution](#data-schema-for-institution)

## Data schema for infrastructure

**Infrastructure** are welcome to share their financial data. Please use the following file to structure the data: [`2025--TSOSI-data-schema-infra-template.xlsx`](./2025--TSOSI-data-schema-infra-template.xlsx).

### Schema definition

The following table describes all the fields of the template spreadsheet. Each individual payment should be entered as a separate row. TSOSI highly rely on the ROR registry. We use it to de-duplicate the data and to enrich with additionnal information like country, website and wikidata identifier. As far as possible, please fill the **ROR ID** column, and you will not have to fill the country, website and wikidata columns. 

- `Data type = Date` values can be entered with one of the following formats according to the accuracy:
    * year format - `2024`
    * year-month format - `2024-03` for March 2024
    * day format - `2024-03-13` for March 13th 2024.

- <span id="required-yes-single-star">`Required = Yes*`</span> - At least 1 of the date fields with this value must be entered. The `date_emitted` or `date_received` fields are preferred.

- <span id="required-no-double-star">`Required = No**`</span> - This is not required but it is strongly recommended to fill it when possible.

## Data schema for institution

TSOSI is working with OpenCost to design a data schema that is accurate for institutions. See the OpenCost data schema: https://github.com/opencost-de/opencost/tree/main
